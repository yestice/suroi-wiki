The **Rock** is an obstacle that spawns frequently around the map. It was added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. The Mossy Rock and the Cracked Rock are variations of the Rock, but are functionally the same.

# Strategies
## Using
- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding behind a Rock to heal and avoid bullets.
- You can hide behind a Rock with a gun that has little range or a melee weapon to force an opponent to approach to where you can get a hit on them.
- Remember that Rocks are breakable and aren't fool-proof barriers.

## Countering
- If there is a rock that an enemy is hiding behind, you can destroy it to avoid getting close to them or to stop them from healing.
- Players trying to hide behind rocks are often low on health, and can make for easy kills.

# Location
Rocks can found be randomly spawned around the map, with no specific locations. Only 200 spawn per map.

# Trivia
- All Rock variants, excluding the Mossy and Cracked variants, were drawn by Leia
